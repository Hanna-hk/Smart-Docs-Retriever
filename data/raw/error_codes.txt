DIAGNOSTIC TROUBLE CODES (DTC) - HPU-2000

E-101: Low Oil Level.
The reservoir fluid level has dropped below the critical threshold.
This is likely caused by external leakage, seal failure, or insufficient filling during maintenance.
Inspect the system for puddles and refill with ISO VG 46 oil immediately.

E-150: Accumulator Nitrogen Pressure Low.
The pre-charge pressure in the bladder accumulator is below the 50 bar setpoint.
This condition may be caused by gas valve leakage, bladder rupture, or natural diffusion over time.
Isolate the accumulator, check nitrogen pressure with a charging kit, and refill if necessary.

E-205: Filter Clog Detected.
The differential pressure across the return filter exceeds 3.5 bar, indicating contaminated fluid or
overdue filter replacement. Replace the filter element (Part No. F-992) and check the oil cleanliness.

E-210: Water Contamination Detected.
The moisture sensor reports water content in oil exceeds 500 ppm.
Causes include heat exchanger internal leaks, condensation due to temperature swings,
or a missing tank breather cap. Stop operation immediately, perform oil analysis,
and engage the offline kidney-loop filtration or schedule a fluid flush.

E-300: Pump Cavitation Warning.
The system detects acoustic anomalies consistent with air bubbles in the fluid.
This is often caused by a blocked suction strainer, low oil level, or air intake in the suction line.
Check suction line tightness and ensure the suction valve is fully open.

E-402: High System Pressure / Relief Valve Active.
System pressure has exceeded 250 bar, triggering the mechanical safety relief valve.
This can happen due to pressure transducer failure, a drifted relief valve setting, or a blocked return line.
Verify the pressure gauge reading and adjust the relief valve setting counter-clockwise or replace the cartridge.

E-501: Thermal Overload / Overheating.
The fluid temperature sensor reads above 85°C. Common causes include cooler fan failure,
heat exchanger blockage, or excessive duty cycle. Reduce the system load, check the water-cooling flow, or clean the air-cooler fins.

E-605: Electric Motor Phase Loss.
The main pump motor controller detects a missing electrical phase (L1, L2, or L3).
This is typically caused by a blown fuse in the control cabinet, a loose terminal connection, or contactor failure.
Lockout/Tagout power, check continuity on all three phases, and tighten terminal block screws.

E-710: Solenoid Valve Coil Open Circuit.
The PLC detects zero current draw when commanding directional valve YV-02.
This indicates a burnt-out solenoid coil, a broken wire in the connector, or loose pin contact.
Measure resistance across coil pins (should be ~30 Ohms) and replace the coil if resistance is infinite.

E-800: Analog Sensor Signal Loss (4-20mA).
The input signal from the main flow meter reads 0mA (Wire Break detection).
This is caused by a severed signal cable, sensor power supply failure, or a disconnected plug.
Check voltage at the sensor plug (24VDC) and inspect cable runs for physical damage.

E-999: Emergency Stop Activated.
The physical E-Stop button was pressed. Release the button and reset the safety relay to resume operation.
