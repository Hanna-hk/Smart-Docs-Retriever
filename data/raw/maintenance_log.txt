MAINTENANCE LOGBOOK - UNIT #42

LOG ENTRY: 2023-10-01
Technician A. Muller completed a routine inspection. 
Oil analysis results indicate a particle count of ISO 18/16/13, 
which is within normal operating limits. The breather cap on the reservoir 
was replaced as a preventive measure. The system is currently running smoothly 
at an operating temperature of 45°C.

Technician J. Smith responded to an operator complaint regarding "sluggish movement" in the main cylinder. 
Upon investigation, a small leak was found in the pilot line near Valve Block B. The fitting was tightened, 
restoring system pressure to 250 bar. The unit was monitored for 30 minutes with no further leaks detected.

Technician A. Muller performed an emergency repair after the system shut down with Error E-501 (Thermal Overload). 
The investigation revealed that the cooling fan was not spinning. 
The root cause was identified as a blown fuse in the 24V control circuit. 
The fuse was replaced, restoring fan operation. The fluid temperature dropped to 55°C within 10 minutes.

Technician K. Doe performed scheduled maintenance. The return filter element was replaced in 
accordance with the 500-hour service interval. A visual inspection of all hydraulic hoses was 
conducted to check for wear and abrasion; no issues were found.

LOG ENTRY: 2023-12-05
Technician J. Smith addressed an issue where system pressure was fluctuating rapidly 
between 200 and 240 bar during idle. The investigation pointed to a suspected accumulator bladder failure.
The pre-charge pressure was checked and found to be at 15 bar, whereas the specification requires 50 bar.
The accumulator bank was isolated, and nitrogen was refilled to 50 bar.
Pressure stabilized immediately, and no bladder rupture was detected.

Technician A. Muller noticed during a routine inspection that the hydraulic fluid appeared "milky"
or cloudy in the sight glass. A fluid sample was tested using a portable moisture sensor,
showing a water content of 650 ppm. The source of ingress was traced to a loose gasket on the heat exchanger.
The bolts were tightened to 60 Nm, and an offline filtration loop was initiated to remove the excess moisture.

Technician B. Evans responded to Error E-605 (Phase Loss) which triggered on startup,
preventing the motor from spinning. Inspection of the main electrical cabinet revealed a loose connection
on the L2 terminal block caused by vibration. The wire end was re-stripped and the terminal screw tightened.
Thread-locker was applied to prevent future loosening. Startup was successful.

LOG ENTRY: 2024-01-25
Technician K. Doe performed preventive maintenance tasks.
The electric motor bearings were greased using Lithium-complex grease.
The alignment of the pump coupling was checked using a laser alignment tool; deviation was found to be 0.05mm,
which is within tolerance. The cooling fins on the air-oil cooler were cleaned using compressed air to ensure efficient heat dissipation.

LOG ENTRY: 2024-02-03
Technician J. Smith investigated a report of a "loud banging" sound heard when the cylinder extends.
The issue was identified as the "Water Hammer" effect caused by the valve closing too abruptly.
The ramp-down time on the proportional valve amplifier was adjusted from 0.1s to 0.5s. The noise was eliminated.

LOG ENTRY: 2024-02-14
Technician A. Muller repaired an oil leak observed under the main pump manifold.
The cause was identified as the O-ring seal on the check valve, which had become brittle and cracked.
The local line was drained, the check valve was removed, the seating surface was cleaned, and a new Viton O-ring was installed.
A subsequent leak test was passed.
