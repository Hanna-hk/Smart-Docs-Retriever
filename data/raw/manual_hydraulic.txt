HPU-2000 SERIES HYDRAULIC POWER UNIT - OPERATION MANUAL

SECTION 1: SAFETY PRECAUTIONS
High-pressure fluid injection can cause severe injury. Always depressurize the system before loosening fittings. 
Personal Protective Equipment (PPE), 
including safety glasses and steel-toed boots, is mandatory within 5 meters of the unit during operation.

SECTION 2: STARTUP SEQUENCE
1. Check the oil level in the reservoir. It must be between the minimum and maximum markers on the sight glass.
2. Open the suction valve completely to prevent pump cavitation.
3. Ensure the pressure relief valve is set to the minimum setting before starting the electric motor.
4. Initiate the motor start sequence. Listen for abnormal sounds. If a high-pitched whine is heard, stop immediately; this indicates aeration.

SECTION 3: OPERATING PARAMETERS
The nominal operating pressure is 250 bar. The system is designed to operate with ISO VG 46 hydraulic oil.
Thermal Management: The optimal operating temperature range is 40°C to 60°C. If the fluid temperature exceeds 70°C, 
the system will automatically enter a cooling cycle or shut down to prevent seal degradation.

SECTION 4: SHUTDOWN
To power down, reduce the load on the actuators. Switch off the electric motor. 
Cycle the control valves to release any trapped hydraulic pressure in the accumulator lines.

SECTION 5: MAINTENANCE SCHEDULE 
To ensure longevity, adhere to the following service intervals:
Daily Inspection: Visually check hoses for leaks and the reservoir for oil level.
Filter Replacement: The return line filter element (Part No. F-992) must be replaced after the initial 50 operating 
hours (break-in period) and subsequently every 1000 operating hours or when the clogging indicator turns red.
Oil Analysis: Perform particle count analysis (target ISO 4406 cleanliness code 18/16/13) every 6 months.
Coupling: Check the flexible coupling between the motor and pump for wear or misalignment annually.

SECTION 6: INSTALLATION REQUIREMENTS 
The HPU-2000 must be installed on a level concrete foundation capable of supporting 1500 kg.
Anchoring: Secure the frame using four M16 anchor bolts to prevent vibration-induced movement.
Clearance: Maintain a minimum clearance of 1 meter around the unit for airflow and maintenance access.
Electrical: Ensure the main power supply (400V, 3-Phase, 50Hz) matches the motor nameplate. Grounding is required.

SECTION 7: LONG-TERM STORAGE If the unit is to be removed from service for more than 3 months:
Fill the reservoir completely to the top to prevent condensation and rust formation inside the tank.
Coat all exposed machined surfaces (shafts, flanges) with a corrosion inhibitor.
Seal all hydraulic ports with steel plugs (do not use plastic caps for long-term storage).
Store in a dry environment with humidity below 60%.

SECTION 8: TROUBLESHOOTING (NON-DTC)
Excessive Noise: If the pump makes a grinding noise, check the oil temperature. Cold oil (below 10°C) has high viscosity and causes cavitation. 
Allow the tank heater to warm the fluid before starting.
Foaming Oil: Indicates air ingress. Tighten all suction line fittings to 45 Nm torque and check the shaft seal.
